The Settings > Shells menu has incorrect menu items:

* Custom Shell
* Custom Game Shell

I think these are leftover placeholders.

Get these removed and any dead code associated with them.

Then add a menu item for the real the "Game Console" custom shell so it can be set as the default, and ensure that the startup code which launches the default shell supports it.
