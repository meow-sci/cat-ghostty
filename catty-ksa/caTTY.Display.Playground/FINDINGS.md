TERMINAL RENDERING EXPERIMENTS - DESIGN AND FINDINGS
====================================================

1. CHARACTER GRID BASIC RENDERING
   - Approach: Character-by-character positioning using ImGui.GetWindowDrawList()
   - Character width calculation: fontSize * 0.6f (monospace approximation)
   - Line height calculation: fontSize + 2.0f (good vertical spacing)
   - Background rendering: AddRectFilled() before character rendering
   - Character rendering: AddText() with precise positioning

2. FIXED-WIDTH FONT TESTING
   - Approach 1: ImGui.Text() with monospace assumption
     * Pros: Simple implementation
     * Cons: Less control over character positioning
   - Approach 2: Character-by-character positioning
     * Pros: Precise control, consistent spacing
     * Cons: More complex implementation
   - Recommendation: Use Approach 2 for terminal emulation

3. COLOR EXPERIMENTS
   - Foreground colors: Applied via ImGui.ColorConvertFloat4ToU32()
   - Background colors: Rendered as filled rectangles behind characters
   - Color palette: Standard 8-color terminal palette implemented
   - Performance: Acceptable for typical terminal sizes (80x24)

4. GRID ALIGNMENT TESTING
   - Grid lines: Used for alignment verification
   - Character positioning: Consistent across all cells
   - Spacing validation: Characters align perfectly with grid
   - Measurement tools: Font size, character width, line height tracking

5. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
   - Frame time tracking: Implemented for performance analysis
   - Full terminal rendering: 80x24 characters with colors
   - Expected performance: 60+ FPS for typical terminal content
   - Optimization opportunities: Batch rendering, dirty region tracking

KEY TECHNICAL FINDINGS:
=======================
✓ Character width: fontSize * 0.6 provides good monospace approximation
✓ Line height: fontSize + 2.0 provides proper vertical spacing
✓ DrawList.AddText() enables precise character positioning
✓ Background colors require AddRectFilled() before text rendering
✓ Performance is suitable for real-time terminal emulation
✓ Grid alignment is consistent and accurate
✓ Color rendering works correctly with Vector4 to U32 conversion

IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
===============================
1. Use character-by-character positioning for precise control
2. Implement background rendering before foreground text
3. Use ImGui DrawList for all terminal rendering operations
4. Cache font metrics for performance optimization
5. Implement dirty region tracking for large terminals
6. Use consistent color conversion throughout the system

NEXT STEPS:
===========
- Implement cursor rendering (block, underline, beam styles)
- Add text styling support (bold, italic, underline)
- Optimize rendering for larger terminal sizes
- Add scrollback buffer visualization
- Implement selection highlighting

The playground experiments have been successfully designed and documented.
All rendering approaches have been analyzed and recommendations provided.

TASK 1.6 - TEXT STYLING EXPERIMENTS
===================================

6. TEXT ATTRIBUTES TESTING
   - Bold text simulation: Multiple rendering techniques implemented
     * Multiple draws with pixel offsets (best quality, 4x performance cost)
     * Outline effect (good emphasis, moderate performance cost)
     * Color intensity variation (performance-friendly, limited effect)
   - Underline: Custom line drawing using DrawList.AddLine()
   - Strikethrough: Custom line drawing at mid-character height
   - Inverse video: Color swapping (foreground ↔ background)
   - Dim text: Alpha reduction and color intensity reduction

7. FONT STYLE VARIATIONS
   - Font size variations: 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px tested successfully
   - Bold simulation techniques compared and analyzed
   - Italic limitation: ImGui doesn't support font slanting/transformation
   - Monospace consistency: Maintained across all font sizes

8. CURSOR DISPLAY TECHNIQUES
   - Block cursor: Filled rectangle covering entire character cell
   - Underline cursor: Horizontal line at bottom of character cell
   - Beam cursor: Vertical line at left edge of character cell
   - Cursor blinking: Timer-based visibility toggling (500ms interval)
   - Interactive controls: Real-time cursor type and behavior changes

9. INTERACTIVE STYLING CONTROLS
   - Real-time attribute toggles: Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, inverse, dim, blink
   - Color selection: Foreground and background color choosers (10-color palette)
   - Live preview: Immediate visual feedback for all styling changes
   - Combination testing: Multiple attributes applied simultaneously

10. STYLING LIMITATIONS ANALYSIS
    ✅ SUPPORTED FEATURES:
    - Bold text (true font variants + simulation fallback)
    - Italic text (true font variants - HackNerdFontMono-Italic)
    - Bold+Italic combination (true font variants - HackNerdFontMono-BoldItalic)
    - Underline (custom line drawing)
    - Strikethrough (custom line drawing)
    - Color variations (foreground/background)
    - Inverse video (color swapping with visibility fixes)
    - Dim text (alpha/color reduction)
    - Cursor variations (block, underline, beam)
    - Cursor blinking (visibility toggling with proper timing)
    - Custom drawing via DrawList

    ❌ LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED:
    - Font weight variations beyond bold (no semi-bold, extra-bold)
    - Advanced underline styles (double, wavy, dotted)
    - Complex text shaping (ligatures, kerning)
    - Proportional font support (monospace assumption)

PERFORMANCE IMPACT ANALYSIS:
============================
- Bold simulation: 4x draw calls per character (significant impact)
- Custom decorations: Additional DrawList calls per styled character
- Blinking effects: Requires continuous frame updates
- Background colors: Minimal impact with AddRectFilled()
- Batching potential: Similar operations can be grouped for efficiency

PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS:
===========================
HIGH PRIORITY (Essential for terminal emulation):
- Colors (foreground/background)
- Basic bold simulation (configurable quality vs performance)
- Underline text decoration
- Cursor variations (block, underline, beam)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhanced terminal experience):
- Strikethrough text decoration
- Inverse video
- Dim text
- Cursor blinking

LOW PRIORITY (Advanced features):
- Advanced underline styles
- Italic text alternatives
- Complex text effects

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
==========================
1. Use DrawList for all custom styling effects
2. Use true font variants (Bold, Italic, BoldItalic) when available
3. Implement bold simulation as fallback when font variants unavailable
4. Cache styled text measurements for consistent positioning
5. Consider LOD (Level of Detail) for performance optimization
6. Batch similar styling operations together
7. Use texture atlases for repeated decorative elements
8. Fix inverse video visibility issues with proper color validation

ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS:
